# What is this?
_instaf1nder.py_ is an instagram lookup software that can search for a user information on instagram. It still on development so it doesn't shows so much informations right now..

# Setup
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/iwansal64/instaf1nder-py.git
$ cd instaf1nder-py
$ sudo ./install
$ instaf1nder
```
here's the one line installation
```sh
git clone https://github.com/iwansal64/instaf1nder-py.git && cd instaf1nder-py && sudo ./install && instaf1nder
```

and that's pretty much it..
Now your computer should can run the program now by typing `instaf1nder`
